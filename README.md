# Songsterr Banner Remover
Songsterr Banner Remover is a Chrome Extension to automatically remove the intrusive Songsterr banner that keeps obstructing tabs.

The extension detects when the banner gets added to the DOM (Songsterr will often attempt to redraw it after removal from the DOM) and also handles situations where the banner appears while navigating between different pages on Songsterr. The extension removes the banner each time it reappears, providing you with a less cluttered and more enjoyable experience on Songsterr.
